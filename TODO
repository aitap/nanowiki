- optional password protection
 (because it's fast and convinient if not very secure to share a single password between a small group of people)
- admincmds
 - dump into single HTML page (regenerated)
  - inter-page links will require special handling; hopefully The Link-Processing Regexp won't need to be copypasted
- conflict detection: compare param("edit") (revision being edited) with mtime of last revision and suggest merging
 - this will require Algorithm::Diff and a new template
- CPANify
- app->config(defaults => ...) wastes 2048 bits of random data on every launch :(
