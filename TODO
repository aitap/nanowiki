- a href: investigate uri_escape vs uri_escape_utf8 - latter does the right thing?
 - fix urlencoding in links: `links2` asks the server for literal utf8 unstead of urlencoded and fails
- controllers
 - use HTTP error codes 404/403/500 for specific conditions
 - use post-redirect-get pattern
- admincmds
 - prune history [until=?]
 - delete page
 - rename page [fix links?]
 - dump into single HTML page
  - special link handling => repurpose existing code
- CPANify
- app->config(defaults => ...) wastes 2048 bits of random data every launch :(
