- refactor:
 ? 'parent' and 'title' regexps are still copypasted across code
 - schema updates
  - employ pragma user_version to store schema version and write alter table commands to upgrade
  - add the primary key (title, time) to 'pages' table already
- admincmds
 - dump into single HTML page (regenerated)
  - inter-page links will require special handling; hopefully The Link-Processing Regexp won't need to be copypasted
- conflict detection: compare param("edit") (revision being edited) with mtime of last revision and suggest merging
 - this will require Algorithm::Diff and a new template
- employ FTS to search the wiki
 - this is definitely a major database schema upgrade
- CPANify
- app->config(defaults => ...) wastes 2048 bits of random data on every launch :(
