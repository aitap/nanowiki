- make the layout behave better on mobile
 - maybe potition the textarea vertically and ask it to occupy 100% width and some em height?
 - HTML5ize the wiki while I'm at it, employ header/article/footer/nav tags
- optional password protection
 (because it's fast and convinient if not very secure to share a single password between a small group of people)
- drop the "filesystem is UTF-8" assumption and use Encode::Locale or something for filenames when exporting/importing
- admincmds
 - dump into single HTML page (regenerated)
  - inter-page links will require special handling; hopefully The Link-Processing Regexp won't need to be copypasted
- conflict detection: compare param("edit") (revision being edited) with mtime of last revision and suggest merging
 - this will require Algorithm::Diff and a new template
- CPANify
- app->config(defaults => ...) wastes 2048 bits of random data on every launch :(
