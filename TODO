- admincmds
 - export to tree of *txt and import from it

  - compare sources and the stored rev number to determine whether an update is needed and notify of conflicts, if any
 - prune history [until=?]
 - delete page
 - rename page [fix links?]
 - dump into single HTML page
  - special link handling => repurpose existing code
- conflict detection: compare param("edit") (revision being edited) with mtime of last revision and suggest merging
- employ FTS to search the wiki
- CPANify
- app->config(defaults => ...) wastes 2048 bits of random data every launch :(
