- refactor:
 ? 'parent' and 'title' regexps are still copypasted across code
 ! 'parent' regexp: supply an SQL function page_parent, set value automatically on insert/update
- admincmds
 - dump into single HTML page (regenerated)
  - inter-page links will require special handling; hopefully The Link-Processing Regexp won't need to be copypasted
- conflict detection: compare param("edit") (revision being edited) with mtime of last revision and suggest merging
 - this will require Algorithm::Diff and a new template
- CPANify
- app->config(defaults => ...) wastes 2048 bits of random data on every launch :(
